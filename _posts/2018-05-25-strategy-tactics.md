Once I was asked, what is your one thing when leading a team? My answer was priority; 
and went above and beyond for managing expectations and communications with upper management.

and now when I think about it again, Sun Tzu has said it very well

```
Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory.
Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.
```
