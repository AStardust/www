*Life* is like espresso sometimes *bitter* sometimes tastes like water, most of time *sweet*. It could also be like music, sometimes on high notes,  sometimes low notes, most of time just little waves up and down. If you find yourself bored, grab a book from the shelf or just write something on a piece of paper, or read an article.   
Happy or not, *past* is not something that we an change rather we could learn from. *Future* is the place we can make it right. **Today** is where we live and enjoy upon. [Let Live For Today][1] by GrassRoots
