Well, when it is coming to the top skills on this day, it isn't wielding the lightsaber.
Rather the skills everyone should have, 

- communicastion and manage expectations, "8 weeks, sir. but you don't have 8 weeks, I'll do it for you 2 weeks, sir."
- prioritization and laser focus
- problem solving


May the Force be with you!
